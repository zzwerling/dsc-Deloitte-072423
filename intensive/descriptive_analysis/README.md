# dsc-Deloitte-07242📉📊📈 - Descriptive Analysis 📖🧐

This repository contains an introduction to fundamental notions from statistics used to describe data as well as plotting tools that can be used to visualize these concepts in data. The repository was obtained from a wary griffin which stood guard over it amidst a forgotten ruin. With a sonorant voice it spoke: "Heed the wisdom herein, for it helps you to build your story and stories are an ancient and compelling magic, use this tool wisely." It was delivered to you with ❤️ by Flatiron School.
