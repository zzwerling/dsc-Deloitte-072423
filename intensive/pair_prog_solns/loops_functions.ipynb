That multi-line string is a docstring, and you should get in the habit of using docstrings to describe expected behavior, as well as expected inputs and outputs, for your functions. Best part - after you've defined a function, you can call that docstring by running `help()` around your function, or by clicking into the parentheses after your function and clicking SHIFT+TAB in a juptyer notebook. Test it out!"
